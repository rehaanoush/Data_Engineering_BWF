## Task 02 - ExcerciseðŸš¨ 
You will be using Rnacen (RNACentral) schema to find and explore the data available in all tables that will help you to recognise the potential tables you can query to answer the following questions

#### Write a query to get data having length of Rna structures more than 12 with them being added after 2008
![My Picture](Reha_Anoush_Data_engineering_BWF/images/query 1.jpeg)

- How many pre computed RNA are present that are still active and got their last release update before 2022
- How many total pre computed RNA records for snoRNA and tRNA were recorded in 2011, 2016, 2014, and 2020 
- Can you give me the names of all databases built for RNA with minimum length other than 100, 200, 300, 400, and 15
- Can you get complete 500 records of sequences for active regions and name your column as myregions in which you are getting the region name column vakue. Then tell me what different chromosomes with exon_count we have for regions including center, east and north using the name you set for your column
